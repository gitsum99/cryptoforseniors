## Practice vs Realtime (Core Design)

CryptoForSeniors is built around a simple principle:

**Learning always comes before risk.**

### Practice Mode (Default)

Practice Mode allows users to learn and experiment using simulated funds and wallets.

- No real money is used
- Real market prices and timing are shown
- Mistakes are safe and unlimited
- Practice Mode is clearly labeled at all times

Practice Mode exists so users can build confidence and understanding
without fear of loss. Users may remain in Practice Mode indefinitely.

Think of it as a **flight simulator**, not a real airplane.

### Realtime Mode (Optional & Locked)

Realtime Mode is never enabled by default.

- Uses real wallets and real funds
- Requires deliberate user action to unlock
- Includes clear warnings and acknowledgments
- Is visually similar to Practice Mode but clearly marked as LIVE

There are no automatic transitions and no one-click upgrades.

### AI Role

AI is used strictly as an educational assistant.

AI can:
- Explain concepts and terminology
- Explain risks in plain language
- Explain outcomes after actions occur
- Assist with translation and accessibility

AI will never:
- Make trading decisions
- Predict prices or outcomes
- Execute transactions
- Override user choice

### Safety First

Security, clarity, and education are prioritized over speed, hype, or promises.

CryptoForSeniors is designed to help people understand crypto —
not to encourage speculation or risk-taking.
