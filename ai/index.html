    <h1>AI Assisted Help</h1>

    <p>
      Crypto For Seniors is being built with AI-assisted tools designed to
      explain cryptocurrency concepts in clear, plain language.
    </p>

    <h2>What AI Does</h2>
    <p>
      AI tools help explain terms, concepts, and processes.
      They assist with learning, translation, and understanding —
      especially for beginners.
    </p>

    <h2>What AI Does Not Do</h2>
    <p>
      AI does not make trading decisions.
      AI does not provide financial advice.
      AI does not predict prices or outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>Why AI Is Used</h2>
    <p>
      AI allows explanations to be clearer, more accessible, and adaptable
      to different learning styles and languages.
      It is used as a support tool, not a replacement for personal judgment.
    </p>

    <h2>Transparency & Safety</h2>
    <p>
      AI features are optional, educational, and designed with safety in mind.
      Users remain in full control of their decisions at all times.
    </p>
